Much of what people think of an science is actually engineering eg no such thing as a rocket scientist only rocket engineers Latter is who put humans on the moon
Science is discovering the essential truths about what exists in the Universe engineering is about creating things that never existedhttpstcoaIEUtHoPxM
justpaulinelol It does get a bit cold at night
engineersfeed Paint makes a hell of a difference
DeepMind Congrats
lrocket Thanks for everything you did to help build SpaceX Some of the best memories ever
RGVaerialphotos It will be real soon
MarcusHouseGame bcart03 nextspaceflight NASASpaceflight Starship legs are one of the hardest problems Externally mounted legs require shielding which adds mass Wider stance adds mass Shock absorbers add mass That said we need better legs
bcart03 nextspaceflight NASASpaceflight Static fire is not risky from build site but we need to clear the build site for early flights
nextspaceflight NASASpaceflight Just a static fire tomorrow Flight no earlier than Wednesday
ErcXspace SpaceX It will have landing legs
eugenelee3 PPathole karpathy Yes very sad news Tony was great
PPathole karpathy For a second there I thought that was a pic of Thanos haha
PoppaBearQ IDAACarmack Yeah truncate zeros amp then round
dburkland IDAACarmack Probably going to a wider beta in 2 weeks
IDAACarmack fp16 with least important digits truncated so it feels like fp32 is what were betting on for training with Dojo
IDAACarmack Int8 for almost all heavy lifting in inference works great

teslaownerssv JohnEG78 TeslaChillMode UNPLGD3 MFrunker ccteslaclub Hopefully next month
JohnEG78 TeslaChillMode UNPLGD3 MFrunker ccteslaclub Ok Overall air suspension height amp damping algorithm is getting a lot of attention Will be linked to FSD so acts automatically
karpathy Haha true
HumanoidHistory The Promise is greatly needed
EvaFoxU We will have special colors for new Roadster as we did for the original
RationalEtienne TheBabylonBee 
TheBabylonBee is savage 
WorldAndScience If you ever wondered where we came from
This is a life leader launch so more risk than normal httpstcoEtFP9IELrf
TesLatino flcnhvy thesheetztweetz Yes but only slightly filled
aholstein404 flcnhvy thesheetztweetz This is a subject of much debate
flcnhvy thesheetztweetz Major upgrades are slated for SN15
flcnhvy thesheetztweetz Many small improvements but overall similar Wiring is more robust engines are more mature nosecone is sealed better etc
thesheetztweetz But thats why we have SN 9 amp SN10
thesheetztweetz Lot of things need to go right so maybe 13 chance
Good Starship SN8 static fire Aiming for first 15km  50k ft altitude flight next week Goals are to test 3 engine ascent body flaps transition from main to header tanks amp landing flip
Erdayastronaut MarcusHouseGame Maybe start on that a year from now Depends on how Starship progress goes
RationalEtienne MarcusHouseGame Not yet
StarshipFairing MarcusHouseGame Not bad We will definitely need more engines if we make the cargo bay all propellant but its probably smarter than a whole new shorter external hull
MarcusHouseGame Rapid amp complete rocket reuse low cost propellant orbital refilling amp propellant production at destination are the four essential elements of making life multiplanetary
Erdayastronaut PPathole Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip Yes
PPathole Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip Were still far from simply video in control out The biggest gamechanger currently underway at Tesla is 360 degree high fps video for labeling training amp inference
Teslarati TeslaRoadTrip FSD Beta 5 coming out in a few days Improvement should be significant
XHNews Exciting mission
vincent13031925 Tesla Wow
LivBoeree Yea
Tomorrow will be the 7th flight of this rocket landing on droneship Of Course I Still Love You
JohnnaCrider1 teslaownerssv 28delayslater Sure
FutureJurvetson flcnhvy True
RationalEtienne heydave7 philwhln We have quiet a queue of products to build Better do new Roadster at some point

tobyliiiiiiiiii SpaceX NASA NASALSP NASAJPL esa Actually off to the side so it doesnt take out the launch mount in bad landing but with the same arm used to pick up the ship
tobyliiiiiiiiii SpaceX NASA NASALSP NASAJPL esa Where it should be
philwhln heydave7 Because I am not an investor Tesla is definitely not the only good company but investing is not what I do But I always put my own money into companies I help create otherwise itd be wrong to ask others to do so

EvaFoxU PPathole mirojurcevic TashaARK SpaceStation It will be better than human vision by quite a margin
ennnafnlaus mirojurcevic TashaARK SpaceStation Reality looks like a strange ghostworld at radar wavelengths Almost everything except metal is translucent
PPathole mirojurcevic TashaARK SpaceStation Exactly
mirojurcevic TashaARK This is a misperception SpaceX developed amp continues to use lidar for Dragon docking with SpaceStation Just pointless imo for selfdriving If youre going to do active photon generation use an occlusion penetrating wavelength like precision radar at 4mm
PhilippeCROIZON SpaceX One day we will fly you on Starship
PeterJBeck Well done
hisdirtremoves SpaceX I cant comment on turbopump internal details but youre roughly in the ballpark Wow rocket turbopumps especially if oxygenrich are insanely hard Arguably the hardest mechanicalfluidscombustion problem known to exist
TashaARK To be clear this was just an XPeng problem Other companies in China have not done this
IsaacLatterell TashaARK karpathy Andrej is awesome but it should be said that we have a very talented AutopilotAI team at Tesla Too much credit comes to me amp Andrej
spacetouristuk TashaARK Yeah They stole Apples code toohttpstcogy4DT7Pq9N
TashaARK They have an old version of our software amp dont have our NN inference computer

AdamKIotz Suvitruf archillect Sure
Suvitruf archillect Haha sexy cropping champion of all time
tweetmenima teslaownerssv If next weeks release looks good we will widen beta
justpaulinelol teslaownerssv Unfortunately there are too many rules around liquor distribution even in the US However we will be selling the lightning bottle amp shot glasses worldwide
teslaownerssv Next weeks release is special Lot of fundamental improvements both important bug fixes amp entire new areas of functionality
westcoastbill SpaceX 13 years amp 11 billion  wow
OwenSparks flcnhvy Tesla Safety is our primary design goal
PPathole AstroJordy flcnhvy Fully
Astronomiaum Let the Martians decide their own future
shifthappends Tesla A lot of my brain space is spent dealing with both units

teslaownerssv AstroJordy flcnhvy No just a mild cold Same with my bro Def had cov2 though Pclt20 means viral load of gt10 million per mL
Astronomiaum Life in glass domes at first Eventually terraformed to support life like Earth
AstroJordy flcnhvy Yeah
DaywalkerxD Astronomiaum I was going to say Sim but that seemed too obvious haha
Astronomiaum Deveras
flcnhvy And cases with high noninfectious Ct should quarantine for a few days while getting another test Second test determines whether theyre just beginning to get ill or are on the long tail afterwards where viral fragments exist but person is not infectious

peterrhague Its designed to make life multiplanetary otherwise extreme overkill for mere Earth sector activity Starship fleet mass to orbit per year will be more than 1000 times all current Earth rockets combined including Falcon Necessary for a city on Mars
Kristennetten royalsociety More like he gave it his blessing It was sort of a groundswell of those who believed in the scientific method in London

westcoastbill Indeed
ReflexFunds nickidk4 pcgamer DojoDoge
PPathole Erdayastronaut rweb11742 Yeah looks like marginal cost of launch will be less than 1M for more than 100 tons to orbit so its mostly about fixed costs divided by launches per year
speculawyer Erdayastronaut rweb11742 Exactly
Erdayastronaut rweb11742 Merlin is a strong local maximum design but kerosene is suboptimal fuel no matter what you do What matters is cost per ton to Mars CH4 is the only choice imo Important O2CH4 allows OF ratio of 35 vs 25 for kerosene so 78 of propellant is oxygen
parstalberg joshbickett ICannotEnough Erdayastronaut rweb11742 Yes but from a visiting American Ah the irony is just too much
joshbickett ICannotEnough Erdayastronaut rweb11742 Yeah PCR Ct was unequivocal at lt20 Doesnt matter what method you use at that low a cycle threshold
flcnhvy LUGG4S1 pcgamer Maybe making some notable changes Will wait until figurative amp literal dust settles
ICannotEnough Erdayastronaut rweb11742 Pretty close Definitely feel  if I take DayQuil Frankly this was one of the mildest coldflu experiences Ive ever had
LUGG4S1 pcgamer Avionics cables moving to steel pipe shields amp adding watercooled steel pipes to test pad
LUGG4S1 pcgamer About 2 secs after starting engines martyte covering concrete below shattered sending blades of hardened rock into engine bay One rock blade severed avionics cable causing bad shutdown of Raptor
Erdayastronaut rweb11742 The most amazing thing about rocket engines is that they sometimes dont blow up The amount of power going through them boggles the mind
pcgamer We should just count the atoms at this point
DJSnM Erdayastronaut CharlesNOtrumps rweb11742 Absolutely Productiontesting of rocket engines is over 90 of the problem This is true in general For cars production is over 99 of the problem That 1 inspiration is very important but its less than 1 of the pain
Erdayastronaut CharlesNOtrumps rweb11742 Our first Merlin engine design was really bad tbh Nothing worked well amp some parts didnt work at all 18 years later amp thousands of upgrades make it a great GG cycle engine

SamTalksTesla Im ok thanks for asking No symptoms for past few days apart from fatigue Unless something changes would have to say that it simply felt like a mild cold

flcnhvy Yeah with cooling channels integrated into the chamber walls
The same propellant is used either for abort or for orbital maneuvering as one use obviates the other
Dragon can also hover amp land propulsively but we use the parachutes for maximum safety httpstcoMr7VFIQwWf

Worth reading this thread if youre curious about rona testing httpstcoFA6kD61eBA
stonkmanup michaelminalab They should be imo If you get a blood pressure test they tell you the number not just if its highnothigh There is not a clear consensus on what Ct value of what cov2 gene constitutes positive
AstroJordy erujabidi A little up amp down Feels just like a regular cold but more body achy amp cloudy head than coughingsneezing DayQuil rocks
michaelminalab In your opinion at what Ct number for the cov2 N1 gene should a PCR test probably be regarded as positive If Im asking the wrong question what is a better question
michaelminalab stendeck77 
teslaownerssv Cool but please be super cautious Expect two steps forward one back Lot of new code was merged
