                Sentiment Analysis, or Opinion Mining, is a sub-field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that tries to identify and extract opinions within a given text. 
                <br>
                The aim of sentiment analysis is to gauge the attitude, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes and emotions of a speaker/writer based on the computational treatment of subjectivity in a text
             <br><br>
            This project uses the <strong>vaderSentiment </strong> Python package,<a href='https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment'><strong> Github Repo found here</strong></a>, to analyze text.
            <br>
            VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.
            <br>
            VADER uses a combination of A sentiment lexicon is a list of lexical features (e.g., words) which are generally labelled according to their semantic orientation as either positive or negative.
            <br>
            VADER has been found to be quite successful when dealing with social media texts, NY Times editorials, movie reviews, and product reviews.
            <br>
            This is because VADER not only tells about the Positivity and Negativity score but also tells us about how positive or negative a sentiment is.

                <li >Neutral Sentiment  0.05 < Compound Score > -0.05   </li>
              </ol>
            </strong> 
            <p1>
              The <strong>Compound Score</strong> is a metric that calculates the sum of all the lexicon ratings which have been normalized between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).
